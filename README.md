# JobleadsUpfrontTasksFrontend

Jobleads HR manager assigned me a task to indicate my abilities in frontend development. I generated this project as a result of that task.
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.5.

## Development server

Befor run this project please run `npm install` for install node modules.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
